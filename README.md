#### Hello, world!

I'm research scientist at [INRIA - Centre of University Grenoble Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-grenoble-alpes), [TRIPOP project-team](https://team.inria.fr/tripop/).
My research focuses on the development of data-driven and machine learning approaches for the constitutive modeling of materials, the structural and fast-dynamic behavior of masonry structures, geomechanics and hydrodynamics.
