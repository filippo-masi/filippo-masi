### Hello, world!

I'm postdoctoral research associate at the [Sydney Centre in Gemechanics and Mining Materials (SciGEM)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/infrastructure-and-transport/sydney-centre-in-geomechanics-and-mining-materials.html#:~:text=The%20Sydney%20Centre%20in%20Gemechanics,of%20geomechanics%20and%20geotechnical%20engineering.) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/).
My research focuses on the development of data-driven and machine learning approaches for the constitutive modeling of materials, the structural and fast-dynamic behavior of masonry structures, geomechanics and hydrodynamics.


Most of the scientific software I wrote for my research is available on this Github page.
